			<h3>The Background</h3>
			<p>Having first launched in 2014, the anonymous messaging app YikYak exploded into popularity. It was first introduced for college campuses, as a way to anonymously communicate with those around you. Very quickly, it became a hotbed of controversy as the platform was used for gossip, bullying, and threats. With that content, YikYak also grew to extreme popularity, and by November 2014, became the ninth most downloaded social media app in the United States.</p>

	<p>The explosive growth of the app attracted investors, triggering several series of venture capital investments. In less than a year, YikYak was valued at over $350 million.</p>

	<p>Then, on May 5, 2017, the YikYak servers shut down forever, and all assets were eventually sold for a whopping $1 million.</p>

	<p>So, what HAPPENED? How on Earth does a company burn so hot and so quickly, that it turns a $350 million valuation into shutting down and liquidating?</p>
		<h3>The Situation</h3>
	<p>As one can imagine, the platform was a breeding ground for cyberbullying because of its anonymous platform. Students took it upon themselves to threaten and bully other people on the platform, inciting several schools and universities to ban the application. While this surely generated negative press and a bad reputation for YikYak, I find it hard to believe this was the source of their downfall.</p>
		<h3>Money Problems</h3>
	<p>In the end, it always comes down to money. A few high schools and shoddy news reports shouldn’t affect the app and its millions of users. So, I reject the idea that cyberbullying was the sole reason for the downfall of YikYak.</p>

	<p>Another suggestion for YikYak’s decline is their failure to establish a revenue model. This, in my opinion, was their biggest issue. For them to accept millions in funding without having a way to make money is grossly irresponsible, both on the parts of the founders and the developers.</p>
		<h3>Winvestors</h3>
	<p>Think about it. All of a sudden, investors are seeing their little baby project explode into a huge product, and they want their investments back. THEY WANT THEIR MONEY, because that’s how investments work. They stand to gain, they’re not just generous patrons. Then, with all of this bad press coming out about the app, the investors were afraid this would damage the app’s potential to make money, so what do they do? Investors started pressuring the founders to make money, and make lots of it FAST while they still have users.</p>

	<p>Even with millions under your belt, generating a revenue stream while your users are already hooked is very difficult. The founders started struggling to pivot their idea into one that can generate revenue. They introduced new features, removed a huge part of the anonymity by including usernames, and changed so many interface layouts around that users could no longer recognize the app. The user experience was ignored, and YikYak paid the ultimate price.</p>
		<h3>Don't make your users hate you</h3>
	<p>Out of nowhere, the product users originally loved bared no resemblance to what they were using. The concept changed, the app was different, and honestly, it started to suck.</p>

	<p>With each new twist and turn YikYak put its users through, they lost thousands of loyal users who had finally had enough. They were using users faster than they can acquire them, and soon started declining at a rapid rate.</p>

	<p>In May 2017, the servers were shut down for good and the service was shut down. Soon, mobile payments company Stripe bought whatever engineers were left over after the several rounds of layoffs, and the intellectual property for about $1 million.</p>
		<h3>Lessons Learned?</h3>
	<p>What are some lessons we can learn from this?
		<ul>
			<li>Always have a revenue model ready to go without having to shift your infrastructure</li>
			<li>Hold your own - be careful not to give up too much leverage to investors when it comes to decision-making</li>
			<li>Users come first. Always remember why they like your product and never forget that.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>So, while it wasn’t exactly cyberbullying that took the app down, perhaps it played a part in the drastic decision to change the fundamentals of the app to generate revenue. Perhaps one day an anonymous social media app will rise again - and do it correctly.</p>
