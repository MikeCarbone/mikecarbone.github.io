			<h3>Yeah, so?</h3>
			<p>We all know Alex Rodriguez. The rookie wonder who ended up being the highest paid baseball player in history? Yeah, that Alex Rodriguez. Well today, he's got a little bit more than baseball on his mind (and no, we're not talking about Jennifer Lopez). Recently A-Rod has been using his wealth, fame and fortune to his advantage, years after his baseball career ended.</p>

		<h3>Ball isn't life</h3>
	<p>A few years after ending his baseball career, Alex Rodrigues founded A-Rod Corp., a wealth management firm that deals heavily in investments. Using the benefits his career provided him, Rodrigues has been massively scaling his wealth, targeting other high-paying athletes as his main clients.</p>

		<h3>No really, check it out</h3>
		<p>He's also started a YouTube channel talking about all of this, his day-to-day life, and more. Here's one of his videos:</p>

<h3>Lesson?</h3>
	<p>This one's easy. Even if you achieve wealth and success, never forget to diversify your income and pursue new challenges to keep you on your toes. On and off the field, A-Rod seems to be taking his career extremely seriously.</p>
