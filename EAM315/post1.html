			Figuring out your passion and what you'd like to do is a universal challenge experienced by most teenagers. Mix in moving from across the globe, you've got a recipe for some early challenges in life. This is the short story of my new friend Li.

			After finding out he had moved from China, I was shocked that he ended up at Drexel. Such a far distance! How did you even hear about this school! After all, I only live about 45 miles away and hadn't heard of it until my junior year of high school. Interestingly enough, Li moved here to attend school before college. He moved to Maine, because there's rumors in China that suburban and rural schools tend to be better than those in the city. Ha.

			By the end of high school, Li had settled on majoring in Electrical Engineering here at Drexel. After years of studying electrical engineering, Li made the brave decision to refocus his interests. It turns out, electrical engineering just wasn't for him. The decision to major in it was originally a compromise between having many jobs to choose from while also having a skill so he can support himself. For a long time though, he loved photography, especially street photography. He always felt it was interesting to capture different ways of life and social statuses going about their daily lives, from rich to poor. The concept of "beauty" was fascinating to him. What makes things beautiful? The compositional element? Positioning? Color?

			At this point, it was clear a change had to be made. After years of electrical engineering, it wasn't worth it to totally give up on the degree, so a minor it was. Li recalled a time where he helped his friend do some usability testing on a website. He found it interesting how design can influence a customer's decisions on a website. This, with the combination of photography, led Li to land on a minor in Interactive Digital Media. The combination is interesting for sure, and I'm positive Li will find ways to make his education work for him in every way possible.
