		<p class="text"><strong>I like playing this game because</strong> I'm actualy able to improve! I started out missing shots but as I learned the mechanics I was able to get higher and higher scores. Small details like the goal shaking when you score made goals very rewarding. <strong>Something that can be improved is</strong> instructions on how to make the ball go airborne. I did it once by accident, but its mostly unclear.</p>

		<p class="text"><strong>I like this game because</strong> it was <italics>addicting</italics>. Who would've thought parking cars would be so fun? I really liked just driving this car around the little world. It made me remember how complicated video games =/= fun. <strong>Only thing that could be improved</strong> would be the inclusion of a mini-map or some sort of overview of the map. Kept crashing because I didn't know where to go.</p>

		<p class="text">This game was pretty fun, <strong>I really liked</strong> cutting up the toppings. The pace of play was really slow and was annoying how I had to click something before cutting it. <strong>If I had to change something,</strong> I'd have them go from start to finish with the pizza process, including the dough and sauce part. The graphics were nice, though.</p>
