		<p class="text"><strong>I like playing this game because</strong> I'm actualy able to improve!  The competitiveness of it really adds to how addicting it is. Collecting the balls is a very simple concept, but the game is still super fun. <strong>Something that can be improved is</strong>, in my opinion, the graphics. To be more specific, the text on the balls over people's names is very annoying when trying to focus. Being able to use the arrow keys would also be nice.</p>

		<p class="text">A very similar style to Agar.io, <strong>I like this game because</strong> it was <italics>addicting</italics>. The snakes compete to try to grow as big as they can by eating smaller snakes. It made me remember how complicated video games =/= fun. <strong>Only thing that could be improved</strong> would be the use of arrow keys or WASD rather than exclusively mouse. Since I'm on a touchpad, it puts me at a disadvantage.</p>
